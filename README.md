# Week-1

This week focuses on dataset preparation and building a basic CNN model for bio-degradation monitoring and detection.  
The fruits and vegetables dataset is imported, preprocessed, and visualized.  
A simple CNN is trained using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify healthy and diseased fruits and vegetables, forming the project’s foundation.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> The dataset is large, so it couldn’t be uploaded directly to GitHub.  
> You can access it via the Google Drive link below:
