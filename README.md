# week-1
Week 1 focuses on dataset preparation and building a basic CNN model for bio degradation monitor detection. The fruits and vegitables dataset is imported, preprocessed, and visualized. A simple CNN is trained using TensorFlow/Keras to classify healthy and diseased friuts and vegitables, forming the project’s foundation.
